# yelpClone

Clone the repo.

Open up 2 terminals.

Make sure you have postgres installed.

cd into the server folder and do

    npm install
    npm start

cd into the client folder 

    npm install 
    npm start

I've intentionally left in the .env with the login credentials to the DB. For the application to run create a DB called yelp on your local system and create 
"restaurant" and "reviews" tables.

I will create a docker image for the DB eventually but for now follow the above steps to setup the DB.
